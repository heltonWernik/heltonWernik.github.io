### First seen in the wild â€“ Malware uses Corporate MDM as attack vector

Check Point researchers discovered a new Cerberus variant which is targeting a multinational conglomerate, and is distributed by the companyâ€™s Mobile Device Manager (MDM) server. This malware has already infected over 75% of the companyâ€™s devices. Once installed, this Cerberus variant can collect large amounts of sensitive data, including user credentials, and send it to a remote command and control (C&C) server.

### Google Play Store Played Again â€“ Tekya Clicker Hides in 24 Childrenâ€™s Games and 32 Utility Apps

Although Google has taken steps to secure its Play store and stop malicious activity, hackers are still finding ways to infiltrate the app store and access usersâ€™ devices. Millions of mobile phone users have unintentionally downloaded malicious apps that have the ability to compromise their data, credentials, emails, text messages, and geographical location. For example, in February 2020, the Haken malware family was installed in over 50,000 Android devices by eight different malicious appsâ€¦

Although Google has taken steps to secure its Play store and stop malicious activity, hackers are still finding ways to infiltrate the app store and access usersâ€™ devices. Millions of mobile phone users have unintentionally downloaded malicious apps that have the ability to compromise their data, credentials, emails, text messages, and geographical location. For example, in February 2020, the Haken malware family was installed in over 50,000 Android devices by eight different malicious apps, all of which initially appeared to be safe.  

Recently, Check Pointâ€™s researchers identified a new malware family that was operating in 56 applications and downloaded almost 1 million times worldwide. With the goal of committing mobile ad fraud, the malware â€“ dubbed â€˜Tekyaâ€™ â€“ imitates the userâ€™s actions in order to click ads and banners from agencies like Googleâ€™s AdMob, AppLovinâ€™, Facebook, and Unity.  

Twenty four of the infected apps were aimed at children (ranging from puzzles to racing games), with the rest being utility apps (such as cooking apps, calculators, downloaders, translators, and so on).
